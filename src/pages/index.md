          We are asking community members to kindly donate $180 dollars a year
          to maintain the Eruv. Please choose the monthly or annual option in
          the form to set up a recurring donation.


          Our highly dedicated team of volunteers check the Eruv every week and

          Eruv functional with necessary maintenance.

          and all donations to our organization are 100% tax-deductible.
